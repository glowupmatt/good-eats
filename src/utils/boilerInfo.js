      "<ol><li>Method:</li><li>Thinly slice the onion and saut over medium in the olive oil.</li><li>While onions are sauting remove the fat from the bacon and chop into pieces; discard the fat or reserve for another use.</li><li>Add bacon to onions and saut for about 10 minutes or until the onions are translucent and the bacon is almost cooked.</li><li>While bacon and onions are cooking bring about 3 inches of water to a boil and add the vinegar. Once boiling reduce heat to just barely simmer.</li><li>Add the spinach and turn with tongs until completely wilted and mixed with the bacon and onions.  Saute for 2  minutes; just until spinach is cooked.  Do not overcook!</li><li>Give the water a gentle stir and just after you add the spinach to the onions and bacon,  drop the eggs in one at a time to poach. (first break the eggs into a cup) 3 minutes will give you medium firm egg; runny yolk and solid whites.</li><li>Divide the spinach evenly between two dinner plates and top with two poached eggs.  Sprinkle black lava salt (if you have another kind of salt like truffle salt, that is great too!) and fresh ground black pepper.  Serve with a large chunk of toasted baguette.</li></ol>",

      "Pat and dry fish fillets. Sprinkle both sides with a pinch or two of salt and pepper. Squirt juice from 1/2 of the lemon and drizzle the coconut milk over top. Turn to ensure everything is coated well. Let them sit at room temperature for 15 minutes to marinate.\nMeanwhile prepare the breading by combining the almond meal, shredded coconut, salt, pepper, ginger and mint in a shallow bowl.\nCover the bottom of a large skillet with oil and bring to medium heat. Lay fillets carefully in the skillet and cook, flipping fish halfway through cooking, until both sides are golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork. Three to five minutes per side for thin fillets, longer if they're thicker.\nTransfer to a stack of paper towels to drain and cool slightly. Serve with Tropical Sweets & Reds Mash.",
